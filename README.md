# uiuc-CHIN-anki
Programmatically creating Anki cards for Chinese classes at UIUC from inside an Anki addon

Currently hardcoded to the name of my deck (CHIN) and uses the fields from the card type I made.
The general idea should be pretty easy to adapt to any deck, or I could change it to be more user friendly


bundled xpinyin and opencc (pure python verison) for filling in terms as anki will not pull from user pc
addtionally, the pure python version of opencc is needed as working with the clib for opencc is a headache
